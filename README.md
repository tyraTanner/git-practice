# git-practice-clone

Notes on git commands

As well as a few command line commands:
ls -la --> this will list all files, including hidden files, like the .git folder where all the changes are saved

What I did here:
So for this file practice, I used git clone and the URL to pull down the repo from gitHub, added the README file and commited the changes. Then I pushed the changes with git push.

I'm gonna open a second practice file and figure out how to push code to an empty repo without cloning it first.
